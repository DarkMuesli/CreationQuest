# CreationQuest

CreationQuest is the approach to develop a **serious game** designed to support **creativity techniques** through a **top-down pixel art RPG experience**, inspired by video games of the 90's.

The game is in a very early state of development and still needs a lot of work to be deployed to people really using it as a source of inspiration.

I am a student of the University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany, and started learning and loving the art of programming in 2012.
There is a entire room in our university being set up right now, dedicated only to creativity and innovation. It will be filed with a whole bunch of options to let your creativity flow and to create new ideas, talk about existing ones, combine them and do all kinds of things with your imagination to create the future.

There will be different approaches available to reach this goal: through the plain meet-and-greet with other people searching for good ideas as well as many ways of support for your creativity through tips and suggestions for creativity methods like and a set of hardware further supporting these methods, like digital whiteboards and tablets. Furthermore, there will be much of this wrapped up in games, be it cards, tabletops or role-plays.

One of these games shall be availible in a digital form, as a video game, presented in an old arcade machine. This repository contains the development for this game to serve me as a backup and versioning tool and to eventually be open for public. ;)


PLEASE NOTE IF WORKING WITH ECLIPSE:
When cloning this project on Eclipse, the asset derectory has to be set manually.
Go to the run configurations of the project, select the DesktopLauncher class and under the "arguments" tab you will find the "working directory" section. Here you must select "other" and the "assets" directory in the core project.
Other IDEs will likely have to be set up similar, but I don't know how.
